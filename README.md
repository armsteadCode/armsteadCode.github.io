# Welcome to My Website ReadMe!

This repository is meant to be the beginning of a professional portfolio website that will be updated over time to include all of the projects that I work on. This website started out as an assignment for a college writing class, but I hope to expand it for real world use. 

## A Little About Me

I am currently a student studying computer science. I know a little bit about a lot of things and my current goals with this website is to create meaningful projects to populate it with (as well as flesh out a "professional" looking website).

## The Website

The website is hosted using github pages at [armsteadCode.github.io]https://armsteadCode.github.io
While github pages only hosts static websites, I have attempted to use a number of different useful web solutions to build a more dynamic site to help show that the website itself is sort of a project in its own right (though it is a WIP).
